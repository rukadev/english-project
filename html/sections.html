              The "Heritage" level is a pivotal moment in Dahlmann's journey, as it symbolizes his decision to embark on a new path in life. 
              The level is designed around a path of crystals, which represents Dahlmann following this new path that he has chosen for himself. 
              The use of crystals is significcant in associating the journey with ideas of transformation and growth.
              In this level, Dahlmann finds himself in a relaxing town that serves as a representation of the comfortable lifestyle he leads working in a library in Buenos Aires. 
              Despite having a seemingly comfortable life, Juan is not content and yearns for something more. 
              It is this dissatisfaction that drives him to embark on a new path, one that is both uncertain and challenging.
              Dahlmann's pursuit is deeply rooted in his romanticization of the southern lifestyle and admiration for his grandfather, who met a heroic fate in the south. 
              This motivation is echoed in the quote, which suggests that Dahlmann chose this path as a way to honor his grandfather's memory and fulfill his own desires.

                The "Arrival" level is a key moment in Dahlmann's journey, as it serves as a transition from his comfortable life living in Buenos Aires, to the unfamiliar territory of the southern prairie. 
                During the level, the character is tasked with constructing a bridge to get from part of the map to the next. 
                The setting of the level represents the new southern landscape that Dahlmann watches out of the window of the train during his journey. 
                The significance of the bridge in this level is that it serves as a physical representation of the Dahlmann's transition from one chapter of his life to the next. 
                The bridge makes a clear division between the way of life Dahlmann is accustomed with, and the new unfamiliar landscape that he is entering. 
                The act of building the bridge is also symbolic of Dahlmann's efforts to adapt to his new surroundings and build a new life for himself. 
                Dahlmann's captivation with the new scenery, as described in the quote, further strengthens the growing hold that fantasy maintains on his perception of reality. 
                His focus on the descriptive details of the new landscape suggests that he is seeing the world through a romanticized lens, rather than approaching it with a realistic perspective.

              In the "Obstacle" level, the character is presented with a task that involves navigating through a dungeon style setting that is filled with a collection of traps and obstacles. 
              The setting serves as a physical representation of the psychological barriers that Dahlmann has envisioned for a seemingly trivial task. 
              The use of this setting reflects the extent to which Dahlmann views his first-time setting foot in the southern region. 
              To Dahlmann, even a trivial walk through an unfamiliar terrain is seen as a significant challenge. 
              This perception is further emphasized by the elaborate design of the obstacles and traps, which require the player to carefully plan their moves and consider the potential consequences of each action. 
              Moreover, the dungeon setting can be interpreted as a metaphor for the southern lifestyle that Dahlmann has romanticized in his mind. 
              The idea of the south being challenging is not just limited to the game's symbolic representation of the setting, but also extends to Dahlmann's own perception of the region as a whole.

              The "Duel" level is a significant moment in Dahlmann's journey, as it represents the culmination of past levels that have resulted in this situation. 
              In this level, the character is tasked with completing a course by defeating enemies. 
              The hellish setting this level takes place in reflects the severity of Dahlmann's circumstances, which further highlights the negative effects of his romanticized perceptions of the southern lifestyle. 
              Along each step of the journey, Dahlmann's growing commitment to the southern lifestyle has led him down a path that leads to an unfortunate ending. 
              The "Duel" level is meant as a powerful symbol of this by highlighting the notion that his journey has reached a point where he must fight for his survival. 
              The level ultimately serves as a reminder of the consequences of allowing fantasy to influence one's perceptions of reality. 
              The severity of the setting and the challenges that the Dahlmann faces highlights the dangers of romanticizing a certain way of life without fully understanding its reality. 
              The level serves as a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of blindly following one's romanticized ideals and the importance of maintaining a realistic perspective on life.

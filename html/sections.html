              In the "Heritage" level, the character follows a path of crystals, which 
              represents his journey of following this new path that he has chosen 
              for himself. Originally leading a comfortable life working in a library 
              in Buenos Aires, this level is set in a relaxing town to represent this lifestyle.
              Despite this though, Juan embarks on a new path within his life, which, based on
              the quote, he chooses due to his romanticization with southern life through 
              admiration for his grandfather. This level marks the beginning of Juan's journey.

                In the "Arrival" level, the character builds a bridge to get from one place to 
                another. When on the train going to the south, Juan takes note of the change of scenery 
                during his ride. The signifiance of the bridge marks the transition from life in 
                Bueons Aires, to the unfamiliar landscape of the southern prarie. The bridge acts to 
                reinforce this change, representing the arrival from one environment to the next. Juan's 
                captivation with this scenery through descriptive detail in the quote demonstrates the 
                hold through which fantasy has on his perception of reality.

              to reach the end. This setting   represent the extent to which dahlmann viewed his first time landing in the south.

              the extent to which he romanticizes southern life.
